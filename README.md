# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

## Introduction
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. It's a common practice in data science to help businesses understand their customer base by grouping customers into segments based on common characteristics. In this project, we analyze a dataset of mall customers to identify distinct groups based on their spending patterns and annual income.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which includes customer information such as Customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

## Prerequisites
To run the Jupyter notebook (`Customer_segmentation_using_KMeans.ipynb`), you will need Python installed along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation
To set up your environment to run this notebook, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the files into your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
## Usage
To use this project, simply run the Jupyter notebook from start to finish. The notebook contains detailed comments explaining each step of the process, from data loading and preprocessing to clustering and visualization.
